Implementations of the assginemnts in EDAF70 applied artificial intelligence course taught at LTH.

Assignment 1 is an implementation of the reversi/othello boardgame. Based on the assignment found below;
http://cs.lth.se/edaf70/programming-assignments-2019/search/

The AI of this assignment is based on the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning together with an
optimizing utility function.

Assignment 2 is an implementation of a HMM that is used to estimate the position of a simulated moving robot. PDFs containing a descrption of the simulation as well as the problem can be found in the Assignment2 directory.

Assignment 3 implements linear regression with the help of gradient descent as well as logistic regression with the help of the perceptron algorithm/model. the full problem description can be found below;
